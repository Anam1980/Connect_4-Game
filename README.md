## How To Play‚û°Ô∏è
* To play the game, each player takes turns placing their pieces on the board by clicking on the desired column. The pieces will drop down to the lowest available space in that column.

* The first player to connect four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled without either player connecting four pieces in a row, the game is a tie.
